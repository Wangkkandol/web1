  <p>In an era of unprecedented domination by two of the game’s all-time greats, it has required something very special to break the duopoly of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Robert Lewandowski provided just that.</p>
  <p>One of the world’s finest players for several years, the 32-year-old moved to another level across 2019 and 2020, inspiring Bayern Munich to a domestic and European clean sweep and topping the scoring charts in both the Bundesliga and the UEFA Champions League. </p>
  <p>Now he has become the first attacker, besides the aforementioned Messi and Ronaldo, to win FIFA’s top award since Ronaldinho in 2005.</p>
