  <p>Twelve thrilling seconds were all it took for Son Heungmin to take the ball from his own 18-yard box and find the net at the other end. The goal showcased everything that has led Tottenham Hotspur fans to fall in love  with their Korea Republic star, with pace, power, persistence and clinical finishing all on show.</p>
